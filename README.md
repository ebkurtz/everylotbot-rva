# every lot bot

everylotbot-rva is a fork of [everylotbot](https://github.com/fitnr/everylotbot)

This library supports a Twitter bot that posts Google Streetview pictures of every property in an SQLite database. 
Existing instances of the bot: <a href="https://twitter.com/everylotnyc">@everylotnyc</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/everylotchicago">@everylotchicago</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/everylotsf">@everylotsf</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/everylotla">@everylotla</a>. Since maps are instruments of power, these bots is a way of generating a tension between two different modes establishing power in urban space.

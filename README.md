## every lot bot

everylotbot-rva is a fork of [everylotbot](https://github.com/fitnr/everylotbot)

This library supports a Twitter bot that posts Google Streetview pictures of every property in an SQLite database.

Existing instances of the bot: [@everylotnyc](https://twitter.com/everylotnyc), [@everylotchicago](https://twitter.com/everylotchicago), [@everylotsf](https://twitter.com/everylotsf) and [@everylotla](https://twitter.com/everylotla). Since maps are instruments of power, these bots is a way of generating a tension between two different modes establishing power in urban space.
